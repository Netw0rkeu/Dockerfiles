Dockerfiles
-----------

In this repository you will find the dockerfiles for my images. I created my own dockerfiles because I like to work (professional) with stable and fixed versions.

Feel free to use this repository if you want to work with stable versions, too. If you need an update then just commit it. I accept bugfixes and upgrades to newer versions of stable software. But please run a test before you do a commit.
